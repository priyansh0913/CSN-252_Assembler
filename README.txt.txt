-> "input_fibonacci.txt" is an example of how to input the format, which can be changed in Pass1.cpp.
-> After running Pass2.cpp, it will generate object code into "object.txt", modification record in "modification.txt".
-> List will be stored in "list.txt" which will maintain address and list of the instructions.
-> Errors, if any, are saved in "error.txt".

Features Implemented: 	-Different addressing modes for SIC/XE.
				-Program Block
				-Modification Record
